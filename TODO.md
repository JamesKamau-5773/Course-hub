# TODO: Add Search Functionality with Multi-Criteria Filtering and Back Button to Courses

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Update TODO.md with the plan steps for tracking.
- [x] Step 2: Edit client/src/Components/pages/Courses.js to add useNavigate import from 'react-router-dom'.
- [x] Step 3: Add searchTerm state (useState('')) and handleSearch function to update searchTerm on input change.
- [x] Step 4: Add back button at the top using useNavigate to '/dashboard'.
- [x] Step 5: Add search input field above the course list with placeholder for multi-criteria search.
- [x] Step 6: Implement filteredCourses logic: Filter courses where searchTerm (lowercased) matches title, course_code, description, or instructor.name (case-insensitive); handle null instructor.
- [x] Step 7: Enhance course list display: Show details like Title (Code) - Instructor: Name - Description in each <li>.
- [x] Step 8: Test the implementation: Restart frontend if needed, navigate to /courses, test search with terms like "Math", "PHY", instructor name, description; verify filtering; test back button; ensure add course works.
- [x] Step 9: Update TODO.md to mark completed steps and note any issues.

## Notes:
- Search is case-insensitive and filters in real-time on input.
- Back button navigates to /dashboard.
- Course list now shows full details.
- No issues found; add course functionality preserved.
- Initial syntax error in JSX fixed; app compiles and runs correctly.
